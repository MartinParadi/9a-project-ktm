    <p class="rally-text">
        Speed, adventure, navigation and many hours in the saddle are all things associated with the incredible sport of rally. Pushing both man and machine to the extreme, rally competitions are among the toughest events on the planet. Riders use roadbooks for navigation while racing at high speeds across varying terrain in some of the most challenging conditions. The most famous and prestigious event on the rally calendar is the Dakar Rally, which takes place annually in January and is followed by sports fans around the world.
    </p>
    <p class="rally-text">
        KTM has enjoyed great success at the event with an impressive 18 consecutive victories between 2001 and 2019. The race, which takes place over 13 days and covers approximately 8,000km, remains the highlight of the season for the Red Bull KTM Factory Racing team. Aboard their KTM 450 RALLY machines, reigning Dakar champion Kevin Benavides and teammates Toby Price and Matthias Walkner, both former Dakar champions, also contest the FIM Cross-Country Rallies World Championship. This series takes place throughout the year and includes famous rally races such as the Abu Dhabi Desert Challenge and Matthias Walkner won the world title in 2021.

    <p class="rally-text">
        For 2022, MotoGPâ„¢ race-winner Danilo Petrucci will switch his knee sliders to knee braces to take on the challenge of the Dakar Rally having concluded his MotoGP career just weeks before. Danilo will compete on a KTM 450 RALLY machine and the Tech3 KTM Factory Racing rider will be aiming to develop his offroad skills and navigation in a bid to finish the world-famous event while learning from his fellow KTM racers and Dakar stars.
